subject: "[CI] [dummy-package-1.2.3-79.el7, task 123456, fixing-bz17] SUT installation failed"
body: |-
  CI pipeline was halted due to the following error:

  CI wasn't able to install the packages under the test. This can have many different causes, e.g.:

      * packages have dependencies that could not be solved in CI environment,
      * there's already a package with newer NVR installed or available.

  Installation logs: some install logs URL

  If you are not sure about the root cause of this issue, contact the CI stuff on #baseosci
  IRC channel, who will help you out analyzing and resolving this issue.
