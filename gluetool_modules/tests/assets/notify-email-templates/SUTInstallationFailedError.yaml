subject: "[CI] [notify-email] [ERROR] SUT installation failed"
body: |-
  CI pipeline was halted due to the following error:

  CI wasn't able to install the packages under the test. This can have many different causes, e.g.:

      * packages have dependencies that could not be solved in CI environment,
      * there's already a package with newer NVR installed or available.

  Installation logs: some install logs URL

  Please, get in touch with component's QE and/or CI stuff to find out how to resolve this situation.
