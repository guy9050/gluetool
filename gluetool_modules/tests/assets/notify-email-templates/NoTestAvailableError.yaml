subject: "[CI] [dummy-package-1.2.3-79.el7, task 123456, fixing-bz17] notify-email No tests found for component"
body: |-
  CI pipeline was halted due to the following error:

  CI could not find any suitable tests for the component. This can have many different causes, e.g.:

    * component's configuration is incomplete, it does not provide correct test plan with tests
      for the component, or
    * the test plan is provided but it's empty, or
    * the test plan is not empty but there are filters applied in the configuration, and the result
      is an empty set of tests.

  Please, see the documentation on CI configuration and what is required to correctly enable CI for
  a component ([1]), current configuration ([2]), and/or consult with component's QE how to resolve
  this situation.
