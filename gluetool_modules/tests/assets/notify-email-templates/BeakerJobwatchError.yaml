body: |-
  CI pipeline was halted due to the following error:

  Beaker jobs started by CI failed to finish successfully.

  This can often happen because of distro missing from Beaker, installability issues, incompatible
  requirements forced by CI configuration for the component, invalid test metadata, multiple timeouting
  tests, or aborted recipes. See the summary and related logs for more details [1], CI documentation [2],
  current configuration [3] and/or consult with component's QE on how to resolve this situation.
