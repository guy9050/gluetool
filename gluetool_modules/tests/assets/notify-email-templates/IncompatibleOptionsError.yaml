subject: "[CI] [dummy-package-1.2.3-79.el7, task 123456, fixing-bz17] Incompatible options detected"
body: |-
  CI pipeline was halted due to the following error:

  Configuration of your component uses incompatible options for `notify-email` module:

      option --foo does not work when --bar is set

  Please, review the configuration of your component - the default settings are usually sane
  and should not lead to this error. For valid options, their values and possible combinations
  see documentation for `notify-email` ([1]).
