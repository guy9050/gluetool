Development
===========

Environment
-----------

Before moving on to the actual setup, there are few important notes:

- **The only supported and (sort of tested) way of using and developing these modules is using Poetry!**

-  The tested distributions (as in "we're using these") are the recent releases of Fedora, CentOS 8 and RHEL8. You could try
   other distributions but we didn't - please, let us know, and it'd be awesome if your first merge request could
   update this file :)


Requirements
------------

To begin digging into sources, there are few requirements to mention:

- ``poetry``, with version < 1.2, installed as described on the `installation page <https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation>`__

- ``ansible-playbook`` installed on your localhost

- system packages - it is either impossible or impractical to use their Python counterpart, or they are required to
  build a Python package. In some cases, on recent Fedora for example, it's been shown for some packages
  their ``compat-*`` variant might be needed. See the optional ``Bootstrap system environment`` step bellow.

Do not worry, the next sections will guide you through the whole installation process.


Installation
------------

0. Bootstrap system environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Following steps are necessary to install requirements for different distributions:

**CentOS 8**

Run all commands listed in the TMT test plan's ``prepare`` section. Test plan is located in the file `plans/centos8.fmf`.

**Fedora**

Run all commands listed in the TMT test plan's ``prepare`` section. Test plan is located in the file `plans/fedora.fmf`.

.. warning::

    Due to the fact we still run with Python2, you will need to install ``virtualenv`` module manually to python2.

.. warning::

    `rpm-py-installer` installation will fail on Fedora 33 and there is no workaround for it. Use Fedora 32 please.

**RHEL 8**

Run all commands listed in the TMT test plan's ``prepare`` section. Test plan is located in the file `plans/rhel8.fmf`.


1. Install ``poetry``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
    poetry self update 1.0.9

.. note::
    You might need to open a new shell to have ``poetry`` command available.


2. Clone ``gluetool-modules``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git@gitlab.cee.redhat.com:baseos-qe/gluetool-modules.git gluetool-modules
   cd gluetool-modules


3. Install ``gluetool-modules``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   poetry install


4. Install extra requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   poetry run /usr/bin/ansible-playbook inject-extra-requirements.yml

**Be warned:** read the messages reported by this step - ``inject-extra-requirements.yml`` playbook checks for
necessary system packages, and reports any missing pieces. **It does not install them!** - we don't want to
mess up your system setup, as we try to stay inside our little own virtualenv, but the playbook will try to
provide hints on what packages might solve the issue. Hopefully, you already have all required system packages.

.. _step_config:

5. Add configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``citool`` looks for its configuration in ``~/.citool.d``. Add configuration for the modules according to your
preference by cloning the repository with your citool configuration. Note that this expects you know where
the repository is, if unsure, ask the maintainers of this project:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone -b staging https://YOUR_CITOOL_CONFIG_REPOSITORY ~/.citool.d


6. Add local configuration (optional)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A configuration you cloned from remote repository in step :ref:`step_config` is often tailored for other task (e.g. CI) while
providing reasonable functionality when used locally. To tweak things for you, you can create a local configuration
``citool`` looks for configuration files in its working directory as well, i.e. when running from your
``gluetool-modules`` clone, it looks for ``.gluetool.d`` (or ``.citool.d`` directory).

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir .citool.d
   cat << EOF > .citool.d/citool
   [default]
   output = citool-debug.txt
   colors = yes
   EOF


7. Test ``citool``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run ``citool`` you can use the ``poetry run`` command, which executes the given command in the virtualenv.

.. code-block:: bash

    poetry run citool -l
    ... pile of modules ...

You can also enter a shell with activated virtualenv by running the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   poetry shell

If you are in an poetry shell, you can run citool directly:

.. code-block:: bash

    citool -l
    ... pile of modules ...


Test suites
-----------

The test suite is governed by ``tox`` and ``py.test``. Tox can be easily executed by:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox

Tox also accepts additional options which are then passed to ``py.test``:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -- --cov=gluetool_modules --cov-report=html:coverage-report

Tox creates (and caches) virtualenv for its test runs, and uses them for running the tests. It integrates multiple
different types of test (you can see them by running ``tox -l``).


Installation tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A collection of installation tests written with the help of `Test Management Tool (tmt) <https://tmt.readthedocs.io/>` can be found at `plans/README.rst`.

Documentation
-------------

Auto-generated documentation is located in ``docs/`` directory. To update your local copy, run these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    ansible-playbook ./generate-docs.yaml

Then you can read generated docs by opening ``docs/build/html/index.html``.


Troubleshooting
---------------

No known issues currently, if you run into issues please contact the maintainers.
